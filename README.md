## My process
- I structured the html
- Creating divs and classics, tbh I didn't really use semantic tags.    Still finding my way around.
- Then I added the Colors and fonts.
- Then used flexbox for the positioning of the elements.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned how to better use flexbox. Although there's still a gap as i forget a lot of things and a lot of trial and error. I'm certain that with practice and more projects I'll get it.

### Useful resources

- [Net Ninja's flexbox playlist on youtube](https://www.example.com) - This helped me better understand flexbox. I really liked using it as it actually does seem simpler than CSS Grid and will use it going forward.
- [Freecodecamp](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing platform which helped me generally understand html & CSS concepts..
